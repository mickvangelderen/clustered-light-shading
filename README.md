Requires SteamVR (installed through steam) and standard OpenGL development
headers and libraries to be installed.

Requires rust (nightly probably)

Probably only works on unixies.

Run with steam-runtime, for example:

```
~/.steam/steam/ubuntu12_32/steam-runtime/run.sh lldb target/debug/vr-lab
```

Disable vsync in the driver if you're using vr. This prevents the buffer swap
from blocking and thus render at your display's frequency which is probably 60Hz
while we need to render to the HDM at 90Hz.

## Dependencies

### Sibling repositories.

`git clone git@github.com:mickvangelderen/gl-typed-rust`
`git clone git@github.com:mickvangelderen/openvr-sys-rust --recursive`
`git clone git@github.com:mickvangelderen/openvr-rust`

### Steam needs QT5.

Also OpenGL development headers are always nice to have.

`sudo apt install qtbase5-dev mesa-common-dev libqt5multimedia5`

## Troubleshooting

1. If SteamVR is running and *then* you plug in the HMD, it will not work, at
   least on Linux by Jan 2019. Kill the SteamVR processes and start the
   application.

2. If SteamVR is not running and you start the application, it might give up
   before SteamVR has completely launched and exit. Starting the application
   again might make things work because SteamVR had time to launch.
   
3. If you're using a single base-station, make sure it is configured as type A.

4. If somethings up with the config path:

### First working version

To celebrate the first working VR version of this project I modeled my keyboard.
The keys come from a single .obj file but are rendered separately. I had to map
each keyboard scancode to the name of each key. Then a virtual keyboard
simulates the key pressure which is transfered through a uniform and used to
translate the key and brighten its color.

### Hot reloading

I wanted my shaders to be recompiled while the application is running as soon as
their source files change. This lets me correct small mistakes in them very
quickly. The vertex layout and everything is static so there is only so much you
can do without recompiling. Pretty neat though.
